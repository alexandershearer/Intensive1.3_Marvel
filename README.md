# Search Heroes and Comics using Marvel's API

## This App was made using react and Marvel's API
## This App also works on mobile and is responsive

#### On this site the user can find heroes on the home page by searching for any hero from the universe and if the API has it in their library then it will display the name, a thumbnail of the hero, and a short description of the hero.

## Plans for the future
#### For the future of this project I plan on making a way for the user to make a list of comics that they want to store and look into later.
